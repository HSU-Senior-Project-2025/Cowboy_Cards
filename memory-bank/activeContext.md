# Cowboy Cards Active Context

## Current Focus

- Completed the debugging protocol rule implementation and testing.

## Recent Changes

- Created test scenario in `memory-bank/debugging-test.md` to validate the debugging protocol rule.
- Updated `.cursorrules` to include the debugging protocol rule in available_instructions.
- Created debugging protocol rule in `.cursor/rules/Core Implementation/debugging-protocol.mdc`.
- Updated `tasks.md` to track the debugging protocol task.
- Previously completed implementing success toast on flashcard completion in `Flashcard.tsx`.
- Previously updated `tasks.md` and `activeContext.md`.
- Previously completed hiding the 'Join Set' button for members on the Public Sets page.

## Active Development

- None. Current task completed.

## Implementation Notes

- **Debugging Protocol Testing:**

  - Created a sample debugging task in `memory-bank/debugging-test.md`
  - Applied the 4-step protocol to a real component issue (SetOverviewHeader.tsx)
  - Identified untyped props issue in the component
  - Wrote 5 test cases for proper type checking
  - Analyzed and proposed a solution with a proper TypeScript interface
  - Demonstrated how the solution passes all test cases
  - Updated tasks.md to mark this as completed

- **Available Instructions Update:**

  - Added entry for the debugging protocol rule in `.cursorrules`
  - Added description: "Systematic debugging approach with 4-step process and test-driven diagnosis"
  - Updated tasks.md to reflect this completion

- **Debugging Protocol Rule:**

  - Created new rule file at `.cursor/rules/Core Implementation/debugging-protocol.mdc`
  - Implemented 4-step debugging process:
    1. Analyze multiple potential causes
    2. Develop 3-5 targeted tests
    3. Verify solutions against tests
    4. Maintain debugging log using template
  - Included standard debugging log template
  - Added complexity level adaptations
  - Created verification checklist

- **Success Toast (Flashcard.tsx):**

  - Modified `handleAdvance` function.
  - Checks if `carouselApi` exists and `cards.length > 0`.
  - Checks if `currentCardIndex` is the last card (`cards.length - 1`).
  - If last card, calls `presentToast` with success message and color.
  - If not last card, calls `carouselApi.scrollNext()`.
  - Removed related `FIXME` comment.

- **Hide Join Set Button (PublicCards.tsx):**
  - Imported `useUserSets` hook in `PublicCards.tsx`.
  - Used the user's set membership data (`userSets`) to determine if they are already part of a public set.
  - Conditionally rendered the "Join Set" button, hiding it if the user is already a member (in any role).
  - Prevented default link navigation when the "Join Set" button is clicked.
  - Fixed linter errors related to async/await and property names in type definitions.

## Reflection on Memory Bank Setup

### What Went Well

- Successfully created all core Memory Bank files with appropriate initial content
- Established proper directory structure including docs/archive
- Created .cursorrules file as a file (not a directory) as required
- Initialized tasks.md as the single source of truth for task tracking

### Challenges

- Determining appropriate initial content for each file without full codebase understanding
- Creating placeholder content that will be useful for future development

### Lessons Learned

- Importance of establishing proper documentation structure early in the project
- Value of having a centralized task tracking system (tasks.md)
- Benefits of structured memory bank for maintaining context across sessions

## Open Questions

- What specific features are currently under active development?
- What is the current state of the application?
- Are there any immediate priorities or bugs that need addressing?

## Next Steps

- Ready for next task.
