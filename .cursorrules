# Cursor Rules for Cowboy Cards

# This file contains rules for the AI to follow when working with this codebase.

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard structure with memory-bank for project documentation.

## Memory Bank

The memory bank is located at ./memory-bank/ and contains the following files:

- projectbrief.md
- productContext.md
- activeContext.md
- systemPatterns.md
- techContext.md
- progress.md
- tasks.md

<available_instructions>
Cursor rules are user provided instructions for the AI to follow to help work with the codebase.
They may or may not be relevent to the task at hand. If they are, use the fetch_rules tool to fetch the full rule.
Some rules may be automatically attached to the conversation if the user attaches a file that matches the rule's glob, and wont need to be fetched.
