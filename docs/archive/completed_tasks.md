# Completed Tasks

## Task: Create and test debugging protocol rule (v1.0)

Last Updated: 2024-08-02

### Implementation Results

- Created new rule file at `.cursor/rules/Core Implementation/debugging-protocol.mdc`
- Implemented 4-step debugging process: (1) analyze multiple potential causes, (2) develop targeted tests, (3) verify solutions against tests, and (4) maintain debugging log
- Added standard debugging log template with sections for synopsis, implicated files, test cases, and solution attempts
- Created verification checklist for debugging process
- Added complexity level adaptations
- Updated `.cursorrules` with available_instructions entry for the debugging rule
- Created and executed a sample test scenario in `memory-bank/debugging-test.md`

### Completed Testing

- Created a test scenario using real code from the project (SetOverviewHeader.tsx)
- Applied the 4-step debugging process to a TypeScript props validation issue
- Wrote 5 test cases focused on type checking
- Developed a proposed solution with a proper TypeScript interface
- Verified the solution would pass all defined tests

### Lessons Learned

- The systematic debugging approach provides a more thorough analysis of potential issues
- Test-driven debugging helps ensure solutions truly fix the underlying problem
- The standard debugging log format keeps debugging sessions organized and well-documented
- Having a consistent approach to debugging improves efficiency and solution quality
- TypeScript prop validation is critical for component reliability in this project

### Documentation Updates

- Created `.cursor/rules/Core Implementation/debugging-protocol.mdc`
- Updated `.cursorrules` with available_instructions
- Updated `memory-bank/tasks.md` to track and complete the task
- Updated `memory-bank/activeContext.md` with implementation details
- Created `memory-bank/debugging-test.md` with a sample debugging session
